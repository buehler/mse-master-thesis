# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

The concept of the "Distributed Authentication Mesh" [@buehler:DistAuthMesh] creates a foundation for dynamic authentication and authorization with diverging authentication schemes. Further, "Common Identities in a Distributed Authentication Mesh" [@buehler:CommonIdentity] defines and implements the common identity that is transported between services. The mentioned projects show with their respective Proof of Concepts (PoC), that it is possible to authenticate a user and transfer that identity over to other applications that do not share the same authentication mechanism. However, both projects only use one trust zone^[A space where applications can "trust" each other.]. While still allowing "zero trust"^[Assuming that each call can be compromised, so all credentials must be verified for each call.], the projects do not enable true "distribution".

In the current state, applications within the same trust zone can communicate with each other and a user only needs to enter his credentials (such as username/password) once. When the user is authenticated, the identity (user ID) is encoded in a JWT for other outgoing calls and the receiving party can validate that the user is already authenticated. Then the receiver uses the transmitted information to encode the identity in the corresponding authentication scheme of the destination [@buehler:DistAuthMesh; @buehler:CommonIdentity].

![Multiple trust zones that share a contract between them. The contract enables the authentication mesh to verify callers from other zones.](images/01_distribution.png){#fig:01_distribution short-caption="Multiple Trust Zones with Contract"}

To achieve true distribution, a contract as shown in {@fig:01_distribution} must exist. The contact defines how multiple parties can trust each other. This project shall define and implement the contract between multiple authentication meshes, such that the Distributed Authentication Mesh can communicate with other trusted zones. To complement the conceptual addition, an open-source implementation of the authentication mesh is provided. The implementation runs on Kubernetes^[<https://kubernetes.io>] and is automated by a Kubernetes Operator.

The remainder of this thesis describes prerequisite knowledge, used technologies and other topics that are required to understand the work. {@sec:state_of_the_art} shows the current state of the Distributed Authentication Mesh project and which elements are missing for the true distribution between security contexts. The implementation section, {@sec:implementation}, provides knowledge about the possible technologies for the contract, defines the contract, and implements the contact along with other implementations needed for the working software. The conclusions section then gives an overview of the results and provides an outlook into future work.
