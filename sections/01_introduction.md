# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

The concept of the "Distributed Authentication Mesh" [@buehler:DistAuthMesh] creates a foundation for dynamic authentication and authorization with diverging authentication schemes. Further, "Common Identities in a Distributed Authentication Mesh" [@buehler:CommonIdentity] defines and implements the common identity that is transported between services. The mentioned projects show with their respective Proof of Concepts (PoC), that it is possible to authenticate a user and transfer that identity over to other applications that do not share the same authentication mechanism.

However, both projects are only distributed within the same trust zone^[A space where applications can "trust" each other.]. While still allowing the "zero trust"^[Assuming that each call can be compromised, so all presented credentials must be verified for each call.] principle, the projects do not enable true "distribution".

In the current state, applications within the same trust zone can communicate with each other and a user only needs to enter his credentials (such as a username/password combination) once. When the user is authenticated, the identity (user ID) is encoded in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is attached to outgoing calls. The receiving party can validate the JWT and verify that the user is authenticated. Then the receiver uses the transmitted information to encode the identity in the corresponding authentication scheme of the destination [@buehler:DistAuthMesh; @buehler:CommonIdentity].

To achieve true distribution, a contract, as shown in {@fig:01_distribution}, must exist. The contact defines how multiple trust zones can share trust with each other. This project shall define and implement the contract between multiple authentication meshes, such that the Distributed Authentication Mesh can communicate with other trusted zones. To complement the conceptual addition, an open-source implementation of the contract and its components is provided. To demonstrate the contract and the distribution of the authentication, a Proof of Concept (PoC) for Docker is created.

The remainder of this thesis describes prerequisite knowledge, used technologies, and other topics that are required to understand the work. {@sec:state_of_the_art} describes the Distributed Authentication Mesh project and which elements are missing for the true distribution between security contexts. The implementation section, {@sec:implementation}, provides knowledge about the possible technologies for the contract, defines the contract, and implements the contact along with other implementations needed for the working software. The conclusion then gives an overview of the results and provides an outlook into future work.
