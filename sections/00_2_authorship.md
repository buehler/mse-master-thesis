# Declaration of Authorship {-}

I, Christoph Bühler, declare that this MASTER THESIS titled "Trust in a Distributed Authentication Mesh" and the work presented in it are my own.

I confirm that:

- Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
- Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. Except for such quotations, this MASTER THESIS is entirely my own work.
- I have acknowledged all main sources of help.
- Where the MASTER THESIS is based on work done by myself jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I have contributed myself.
